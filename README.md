# Stop_Watch
Implement Stop Watch Timer Using At-Mega32

## Specifications:
1- ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.

2- Configure Timer1 in ATmega32 with CTC mode to count the Stopwatch time.

3- Use six Common Anode 7-segments With decoder 7447.

4- Configure External Interrupt INTO with falling edge.
Connect a push button with the internal pull-up resistor.
If a falling edge is detected the Stopwatch time should be reset.

5- Configure External Interrupt INT1 with rising edge.
Connect a push button with the external pull-down resistor.
If a rising edge is detected the Stopwatch time should be paused.

6-Configure External Interrupt INT2 with a falling edge.
Connect a push button with the internal pull-up resistor.
If a falling edge is detected the Stopwatch time should be resumed.
